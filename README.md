# Simple-DApp-Game

This project is a simple decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The DApp is a game where players can pay 0.01 ETH to play, and depending on a random number generated by the contract, they may win double their entry fee.

## Project Structure

- **Smart Contract**: Developed using Solidity, responsible for managing the game logic and player rewards.
- **Frontend**: Built with HTML and integrated with Web3.js to interact with the smart contract on the Ethereum network.
  
### Features

1. Players pay 0.01 ETH to play the game.
2. A simple random number is generated to determine if the player wins.
3. If the player wins, they receive double their initial entry fee.
4. Players can withdraw their balance from the contract at any time.

## How to Use

   ```bash
